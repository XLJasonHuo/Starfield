  Due to the fact that Mahdi had a lot of work for other courses, he didn't have time to write/code down all the information for this website or for the slides. 
 
 HOWEVER, we were in a call everytime we work on this summative, he will always give his opinion and how he wants this presentation or website to look like, he 
would always make sure we're on the right track. I wanted to address this because Github has this timer that would count the amount of time contributors spend on the website,
although Mahdi didn't have time to write information down, he always gave his ideas, all i have to do is write his ideas and information down, this goes to our presentation, 
script and this website.
